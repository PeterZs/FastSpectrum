## Fast Approximation of Eigenproblem of Laplace-Beltrami Operator from Triangle Mesh

We _approximate_ the lowest part of the _eigenvalues_ and _eigenfunctions_ of **Laplace-Beltrami operator**, to have a faster speed, less storage, and quicker mapping to world coordinates. Our general idea is to construct a **subspace** (from the original space) that can approximate the _low frequency (smooth)_ functions on the manifold. Then we will solve the eigenproblem _restricted to such subspace_.

Here is main component of our approximation scheme:
1. Construct a subspace  
   1. sampling 
   2. radial basis functions 
   3. partition of unity  
2. Solve the eigenproblem in subpace  
   1. low-dim eigenproblem
   2. lift the eigenfunction (only when necessary/as requested since it's expensive for memory)

Please note that this program requires **Eigen**, **LibIGL**, and an **eigensolver** (e.g. **CUDA's cuSOLVER** function).

## How to Compile and Run Our Implementation

We use **CMake** for easy installation/deployment on your machine, by creating a CMakeFiles.txt that hopefully do (almost) everything to make our code runs in your machine. Here are the steps to get our program runs:

1. **Clone** our repository **recursively** using `git clone https://github.com/a-nasikun/FastSpectrum --recursive`.
2. **Compile** the following **dependencies** on their respective subfolders using CMake:
   1. glad (which is located at `/libigl/external/glad`)
   2. glfw (it is located at `/libigl/external/glfw`)   
       Make sure you can locate the **glad.lib** and **glfw.lib** after compilation because you will need that to run libigl (viewer).
3. **Configure** and generate our program (e.g. a Solutin in Visual Studio) using CMake (We use CMake 3.9.3 in our test). Be ready to specify/insert the **following directories** on which our program depends on:
   -    **IGL_DIR:** (`path/to/libigl`)                 
       Location of the directory where you have libIGL (as libIGL is also downloaded when you clone our repository, it should be easy to locate. It is one of the 'subfolder' in the main directory of your local working directory.    
   -    **EIGEN_DIR:** (`path/to/libigl/external/eigen`)                 
    Location of the Eigen directory. If you clone recursively, then it will be at libigl/external/eigen.   
   -    **IMGUI_DIR**: (`path/to/libigl/external/imgui`)                 
       Location of the Dear ImGUI directory, which should be at libigl/external/imgui   
   -    **GLFW_INCLUDE_DIR**: (`path/to/libigl/external/glfw`)                 
        Path of the GLFW directory, which should be at libigl/external/glfw   
   -    **GLFW_LIBRARY_DIR**: (`path/to/glfw.lib/in/your/glfw/folder`)                 
        Location of **glfw.lib** file in your directory, this will differ for each machine/compiler. Please locate the file after you compile the glfw directory.    
   -    **GLAD_INCLUDE_DIR**: (`path/to/libigl/external/glad`)                 
        Location of the GLAD directory, which should be at libigl/external/glad   
   -    **GLAD_LIBRARY_DIR**: (`path/to/glad.lib/in/your/glad/folder`)                 
        Location of **glad.lib** file in your directory, this will differ for each machine/compiler. Please locate the file after you compile the glad directory. 
4. It should be working and **running** without any problem.
   If some headers/libraries are missing (perhaps because you locate the wrong folder), you could specify it directly in your application. For example, in Visual Studio you could go to `Project >> Properties >> C/C++ >> General >> Additional Include Directories`.

Having followed those steps, our program **should compile and run** well. This program is still under continuous development, so please expect some errors/bugs/mistakes within it. If you have any problem compiling it or having some nice suggestion(s) or question(s), please drop me an **email** at `a.nasikun[at]tudelft.nl`.
